    "text": "1.2 Preqrequisites\n\n1.2.1 Familiarity with Nextflow\nThis workshop is intended to help improve writing of Nextflow workflows. As such we expect participants to be able to write basic Nextflow scripts, be able to script in a scripting language such as Bash/Python/R, and be familiar with their compute environment and job submission software.\n\n\n1.2.2 Formatted code\nClean and readable code allows us to better understand what you’re attempting to do. Follow the formatting guidelines on Formatting Advice.\n\n\n1.2.3 A test data set\nWhen you’re prototying/developing a workflow, you want to keep writing code while you’re still in the flow of it. Having an aggressively subsampled data set means you’re not waiting long for tools to finish their job before you can move on to coding/fixing the next steps. Sometimes this is not possible, but making a best effort can help when you want to develop quickly, and allows you to construct a test suite for adding to the workflow without breaking it in the future.\n\n\n1.2.4 Learning Outcomes\n\nLearners will be able to formulate what they want their workflow to achieve ( publishable, portable, FAIR, etc).\nLearners will be able to find resources to help them work towards a specific goal.\nLearners will be able to identify what to target in their workflow to achieve a specific goal.\nLearners will have made some changes to their workflow to achieve certain goal.",
